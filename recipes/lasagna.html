    <p> Homemade lasagna is the best. It tastes nothing like the ones from the frozen food aisle. This recipe is so good—its the kind of lasagna people write home about! It brings together all of the things we love in a good pasta dish: noodles, cheeses, fresh herbs and a delicious meat sauce. If you’ve never made lasagna before or haven’t found a good recipe, you have come to the right place. Invite a friend because you won’t want to keep this dish to yourself. </p>

        <li> 1 pound lean ground beef </li>
        <li> 1 large white onion diced </li>
        <li> 5 cloves garlic minced </li>
        <li> 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes </li>
        <li> 2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste </li>
        <li> 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup white wine </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons white sugar </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally. </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water. </li>
        <li> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna. </li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan. </li>
